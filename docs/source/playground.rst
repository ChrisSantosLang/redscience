On the playground page, the other player(s) display on the left with
their color(s) (if assigned). The system summarizes their play history 
by classifying their relative expertise and the degree to which they 
are "owed" favors. Such statistics may be useful to support social 
stategies (but players are free to ignore the labels if they wish). 

The board(s) display in the center of the playground. The time bar  
below it indicates the amount of time left in the current turn. 
Depending upon how you choose to augment your intelligence (if at all),
calculations may appear on the board along with suggested
moves and justifications. Click the board to 
enter/change your move(s) when it is your turn.

Your move selection displays in the upper-right with a button. Click the 
button to accept the move. In the lower-right, your 
reserves (if any) display, along with a private randomly-generated 
impulse (useful in strategies that require randomness). Hover over 
pieces in reserve to display rules for those pieces. Hover over 
specially-patterned regions of the board to display special rules for 
those regions. Hover over the rules to preview rules for future phases 
(if any).

Note that for some games (e.g. *Hide and Seek*), different elements 
may be visible to different players (unlike with physical board games).
A player cannot move a placed piece if the player has an identical 
piece in reserve, and cannot attempt to place a piece from reserves 
to a location that the player knows is occupied.
