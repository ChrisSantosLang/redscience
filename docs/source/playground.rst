On the playground, the other player(s) display on the left with
their color(s) (if assigned). The system summarizes their play history 
by classifying their relative expertise and the degree to which they 
are "owed" favors. Such statistics may be useful to support social 
stategies (but players are free to ignore these labels). 

The board(s) display in the center of the playground. The time bar on 
the bottom indicates the amount of time left in the current turn. 
Depending upon how you choose to augment your intelligence (if at all),
suggestions/calculations may appear on the board. Click the board to 
specify your moves when it is your turn.

Your move selection displays in the upper-right with a button. Click the 
button to accept the move. Depending upon how you 
choose to augment your intelligence (if at all), move(s) may be 
suggested and justifications may be offered. In the lower-right, your 
reserves (if any) display, along with a private randomly-generated 
impulse (useful in strategies that require randomness). Hover over 
pieces in reserve to display rules for those pieces. Hover over 
specially-patterned regions of the board to display special rules for 
those regions. Hover over the rules to preview rules for future phases 
(if any).

For some games (e.g. *Hide and Seek*), different elements are visible 
to different players.
