How to Compare Coding Options
=============================

(Under construction)

This will be a Colab notebook demonstrating procedural, functional, 
and recursive approaches to the cartc function and how to compare 
them via profiling, performance measurement, time complexity 
estimation, and radon code quality metrics. It is an optional 
"side trip" for students who want to learn to code from examples,
or who want to review their coding knowledge.
