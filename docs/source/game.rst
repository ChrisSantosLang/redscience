Tic-Tac-Toe is just one of many possible games, and each 
game has its own **Leaderboard**. Click the |gamebutton| button next
to the name of any game to launch its page:

* The **Leaderboard Tab** provides buttons to see :doc:`player <player>` 
  stats, compare players, and start new :doc:`matches <play>`
* The **Tournaments Tab** provides buttons to see recent 
  :doc:`tournaments <tournament>`
* The **Compare Tab** provides buttons to compare games (and to design
  a better :doc:`Olympics <tournament>`)

If the game is an *event*, then it will have a **Setup & Rules Tab** 
as shown above. If the game is an *Olympics*, then it will have an 
**Events Tab** instead, with buttons to launch the page of each event. 
Either tab will have a **Copy** button you can use to make a version 
with different :doc:`rules <gamefactory>`.
