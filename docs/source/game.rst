Tic-Tac-Toe is one of many possible games, each 
with its own **Leaderboard** (for each *Universe*). 

Click the |gamebutton| button next to the name of any game 
to launch its page:

* The **Leaderboard Tab** provides buttons to see :doc:`player <player>` 
  stats, start new :doc:`matches <play>, and compare players. 
* The **Tournaments Tab** provides buttons to see recent 
  :doc:`tournaments <tournament>`
* The **Compare Tab** provides buttons to compare games (and to design
  a better :doc:`Olympics <tournament>`)

If the game is an *event*, then it will have a **Setup & Rules Tab** 
as shown above. If the game is an *Olympics*, then it will have an 
**Events Tab** instead with buttons to launch the page of each event. 
Either tab will have a **Copy** button you can use to make a version 
with different :doc:`rules <gamefactory>`.
