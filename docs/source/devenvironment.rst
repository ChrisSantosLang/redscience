How to Set-up Your Development Environment
=========================================

Now that you have read the Requirements, Testing Plan, and Potential
Mockups for `Command Line Tic-Tic-Toe <commandline>`_, let's begin to code it together.
The first thing you will need to do--only for the first Release--is 
to set-up your development environment. You are welcome to use any 
environment you like, but software architecture includes planning for 
how code will be versioned, deployed, and debugged, so we have a plan 
for you. A great architecture might also include a coding style guide 
like the one at https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html. 
We'll just point you to that one.

Here's a summary of our plan:

1. Set up a **GitHub** account, and clone the redscience template to get 
   the initial set-up.
2. Set up a **Google** account
3. In **Google Colab**, mount your Google Drive, then clone your GitHub 
   project to your Google Drive where you can edit and run your code 
   in the cloud.
4. Test your revisions with XXX and commit them to GitHub

We will walk you through step 4 later, when you have code to commit. 
This article will walk you through step 1 and explain what you have 
inherited from the template, then point you to other resources that 
cover later steps.


First, if you don't already have a GitHub account, follow 
`these instructions <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account>`_
to get one. 
 
Now, if you don't already have a Google account, follow 
`these instructions <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en#>`_ 
to get one, then move forward to
