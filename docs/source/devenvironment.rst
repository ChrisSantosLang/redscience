How to Set-up Your Development Environment
==========================================

Now that you have read the Requirements, Testing Plan, and Potential
Mockups for `Command Line Tic-Tic-Toe </source/releases/commandline>`_, let's begin to code it together.
The first thing you will need to do--only for the first Release--is 
to set-up your development environment. You are welcome to use any 
environment you like, but software architecture includes planning for 
how code will be versioned, deployed, and debugged, so we have a plan 
for you. A great architecture might also include a coding style guide 
like the one at https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html. 
We'll just point you to that one.

Here's a summary of our plan:

1. Set up a **GitHub** account, and clone the redscience template to get 
   the initial set-up.
2. Set up a **Google** account
3. In **Google Colab**, mount your Google Drive, then clone your GitHub 
   project to your Google Drive where you can edit and run your code 
   in the cloud.
4. Test your revisions with XXX and commit them to GitHub

Step 4 will be deferred until you have code to commit. This article 
will walk you through step 1, explain what you have inherited 
by cloning the template, then point you to other resources that 
cover later steps.

Getting Respository Permissions
-------------------------------

First, if you don't already have a GitHub account, follow 
`the GitHub instructions <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account>`_
to get one. 

If you intend to contribute to an existing repository, then fork it.
If you want to build your own code base, then the plan is to start by 
clicking "Use this template" at 
https://github.com/ChrisSantosLang/redscience (instructions from
GitHub `here <https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template>`_)

[Describe folder structure and explain configuration files here]
 
Now, if you don't already have a Google account, follow 
`the Google instructions <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en#>`_ 
to get one, then move forward to How to Develop in Colab with GitHub.
