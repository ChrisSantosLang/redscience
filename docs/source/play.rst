If you just want to "kick the tires" then you do not need a user
account.

As an anonymous user, on the Home page, you can select
a game and other player(s). If you select a way to augment your 
intelligence (i.e. do not play "alone"), then you can also select an
artificial intellience with which to augment yourself. 
Clicking the button next to the name of a :doc:'game <game>' or 
:doc:'player <player>' launches a page for that game or player. 
Clicking the *Play New* button starts the game.
