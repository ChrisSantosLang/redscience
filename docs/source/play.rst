How to Play
===========

If you just want to "kick the tires" then you do not need a user
account.

As an anonymous user, on the Home page, you can select
a game and other player(s). If you select a way to augment your 
intelligence (i.e. not "alone"), then you can also select an
artificial intellience with which to augment your intelligence. 
Clicking the button next to the name of a game or player launches
a page for that game or player where you can see statistics (e.g.
a leaderboard). Clicking the "Play New" button starts the game.

On the playground, the other player(s) display on the left along with
their color(s), if assigned. The system also classifies other players 
based on relative expertise (in previous play) and degree to which they 
are "owed" favors. 

The board(s) display in the center of the playground. The time bar on 
the bottom indicates the amount of time left in the current turn. 
Depending upon how you choose to augment your intelligence (if at all),
suggestions/calculations may appear on the board. Click the board to 
specify your moves when it is your turn.

Your move selection displays in the upper-right. You may click a button 
next to a fully-specified move to accept it. Depending upon how you 
choose to augment your intelligence (if at all), move(s) may be 
suggested and justifications may be offered. In the lower-right, your 
reserves (if any) display, along with a private randomly-generated 
impulse (useful in strategies that require randomness). Hover over 
pieces in reserve to display rules for those pieces. Hover over 
specially-patterned regions of the board to display special rules for 
those regions. If a game has phases, hover over the title to preview 
rules for future phases.

For some games (e.g. "Hide and Seek"), different elements are visible 
to different players...

Advancing Social Science
------------------------

Even an anonymous user could help train artificial intelligence by 
playing against it, but the biggest advances in social science will come 
from inventing personalities, teams, and games that are in some way 
"better" than those previously known. 

Clicking the "Login/Change User" button in the upper right corner allows 
you to login or create a new account. As a logged-in user, you will see 
a "Copy" button on game and player pages. You can click them to create 
new games and players. If your inventions challenge the rest of the 
community, then those inventions advance social science (which may 
be used to engineer social institutions which are better in some way).
