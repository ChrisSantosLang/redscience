Even an anonymous user could help train artificial intelligence by 
playing against it. However, the biggest advances in social science will 
come from inventing :doc:`new personalities <playerfactory>`, teams, and 
:doc:`games <gamefactory>` that are in some way "better" than those previously 
known. Only logged-in users can be a *Creator*.

Click the **Login/Change User** button |loginbutton| in the upper 
right corner to login or create a new account.

Click the **Player** button |playerbutton| next to a player's name 
to launch its page:

Click the avatar, name, and/or email address at the top of your player page to 
change it. Your email address is visible only to yourself and to *Admins*. 

* The **Creations Tab** provides buttons to launch all players and games 
  created by that player. The usage statistic gives the average popularity 
  of each creation over its life. 
* The **Stats Tab** provides buttons to graph the evolution of the
  player for various :doc:`games <game>` and to challenge the player to 
  new :doc:`matches <play>`. 
* The **Favoritism Tab** highlights other players who have
  historically exhibited special relationships with the player. It 
  is useful to detect security vulnerabilities inherent to
  a specific AI (or human; yes, humans can have vulnerabilities
  too).

Logged-in users, see a **Copy** button on game and player pages. 
You can create another *Persona* for yourself by clicking the **Copy**
button on the page of any human player. A *Persona* can be in a 
different *Universe*, which would give it access to play with 
other players in that *Universe*. Inviting a human to play in 
a non-public *Universe* automatically gives them a *Persona* in 
that *Universe*, Thus, you could establish private scoring among 
a group of friends by inviting them to play against a *Persona* in 
your own private *Universe*.
