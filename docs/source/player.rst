Even an anonymous user could help train artificial intelligence by 
playing against it. However, the biggest advances in social science will 
come from inventing new personalities, teams, and games that are in some way 
"better" than those previously known. Only logged in users can create
new players, teams, and games.

Click the **Login/Change User** button |loginbutton| in the upper 
right corner allows you to login or create a new account.

Click a **Player** button |playerbutton| next to that player's name 
to launch its page:

You can change your avatar, name, and/or email address on your player
page. Your email address is visible only to yourself and to 
Admins. 

* The **Creations Tab** provides buttons to launch all players and games 
  the player created created by that player. The usage statistic
  gives the average popularity of each creation over its life. 
* The **Stats Tab** provides buttons to graph the evolution of the
  player for various games and to challenge the player to new matches. 
* The **Favoritism Tab** highlights other players who have
  historically exhibited special relationships with the player and 
  provides buttons to explore and document their Social Histories

As a logged-in user, you will see a **Copy** button on game and 
player pages. If your modified versions challenge the rest of the 
user community, then those inventions are advances to social science. 
If you copy the page of a human player, you will create another
*Persona* for yourself, which could be in a different *Universe*.
You could establish private scoring among a group of friends by  
inviting them to play against a *Persona* in your own private 
*Universe*.
