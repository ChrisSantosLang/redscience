The Player Page
===============

Even an anonymous user could help train artificial intelligence by 
playing against it. However, the biggest advances in social science will 
come from inventing new personalities, teams, and games that are in some way 
"better" than those previously known.

Clicking the **Login/Change User** button |loginbutton| in the upper 
right corner allows you to login or create a new account. Click on a 
**Player** button |playerbutton| to launch the page for that player:

If it is your own page, then this is where you can change your avatar,
name, and/or email address. Your address is visible only to yourself and to 
Admins. 

* The **Creations Tab** provides buttons to launch all players and games 
  created by that player.
* The **Stats Tab** provides buttons to challenge the player to 
  play various games 
* The **Favoritism Tab** provides buttons to see opponents' stats

As a logged-in user, you will see a **Copy** button on game and 
player pages. If your modified versions challenge the rest of the 
user community, then those inventions are advances to social science.

Click the **Copy** button to create a new 
player. Players created in this way will have no email address, but their
*Type* and *Universe* will be editable until the creator leaves the 
page for the first time. (If you want to edit the *Type* 
or *Universe* after that, just make a new copy of the player!) 

You can establish private scoring among a group of friends by copying 
your own player page to give yourself a *Persona* in a private Universe, 
then inviting your friends to play against that *Persona*. 

If you set the *Type* of the new player to *AI*, *Team* or *Corp*, 
instead of *Persona*, then it will have a
**Curriculum Tab** or **Members Tab** instead of a **Creations Tab**:

The creator can edit any settings until leaving the page for the first 
time. If you want to alter an *AI* after that, you can "fork" it for 
a given timestamp. This is another way to copy, but does not copy any 
learning that occured after the timestamp. If an *AI* is ever harmed 
by its learning, it can be "rewound" to a timestamp. Another way an 
*AI* can be altered by its creator is to cause *new* learning by 
adding recorded games to its curriculum: specifiying parts of tournaments 
for the *AI* to study, or parts of other players' histories. Its creator 
can also set the *AI* to learn from its own experiences. 

You can use any *AI*, *Team* of AI, or *Corp* of AI as a tool to help you
play, so finding the best and making it even better can be a 
powerful way to raise your rankings.
