Tournaments are for non-human players (they involve many more :doc:`matches<playground>`  
than human stamina would permit). They are experiments to confirm 
which :doc:`non-human player<playerfactory>` is better than another at a specific event or 
in general (i.e. for the most comprehensive Olympics_).

.. _Olympics:
Olympics are games composed of diverse events which no competitor
has ever encountered before. Rather than play an Olympic event 
directly, a player must copy itself, the copy plays (although the
outcomes impact the skill-level of the original), and the copy can never 
play again. That prevents players from mastering Olympic events in
advance--it is a race to develop new mastery--so Olympic champions 
are the players most likely to succeed when facing novel situations
(or in competitions won by changing the game). 

Trainers can create a new tournament from a :doc:`Leaderboard <game>` or 
:doc:`Favoritism Tab <player>`, using the checkboxes to select players. Special
security is required because a very complicated tournament could take 
days to run.
