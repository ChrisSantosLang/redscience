Tournaments are for non-human players (they involve many more :doc:`matches<playground>`  
than human stamina would permit). They are experiments to confirm 
which :doc:`AI, Team, or Corp <playerfactory>` is the best at a specific event or 
in general (i.e. for the most comprehensive Olympics_).

.. _Olympics:
Olympics are games composed of diverse events which no competitor
has ever encountered before. Rather than play an Olympic event 
directly, a player must create a copy of itself to play (although the
outcomes impact the skill-level estimate of the original). The copy is 
archived never to play again--that prevents players from mastering 
Olympic events in advance. An Olypics is a race to develop new mastery, 
so Olympic champions are the players most likely to succeed when facing 
novel situations (or in competitions won by changing the rules). 

Trainers can create a new tournament from a :doc:`Leaderboard <game>` or 
:doc:`Favoritism Tab <player>`, using the checkboxes to select players. Special
security is required because a very complicated tournament could take 
days to run.
