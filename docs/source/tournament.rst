The Tournament Page
===================

Tournaments are for non-human players (they involve many more matches 
than human stamina would permit). They are experiments to confirm 
whether one player tool is better than another at a specific event or 
in general (i.e. for the most comprehensive Olympics).  

Click on a **Tournament** button |tournamentbutton| to launch the page 
for that tournament:

Olympics are games composed of diverse events which no competitor
has ever encountered before. Rather than play any Olympic event 
directly, a player must enter a copy of itself, and the copy can never 
play again. That means players cannot win by mastering the events in
advance--all competitors are in a race to develop new mastery--so 
Olympic champions are the players most likely to succeed when facing 
novel situations. 

Trainers can create a new tournament from a **Leaderboard** or 
**Favoritism Tab**, using the checkboxes to to select players. Special
security is required because a very complicated tournament could take 
days to run.
