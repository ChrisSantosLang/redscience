The Tournament Page
===================

Tournaments are experiments to confirm whether one player tool is more
intelligent than another for a specific event or in general (i.e. for 
the most comprehensive Olympics). Tournaments involve many more matches 
than human stamina would permit. Humans can benefit from tournaments by 
using them to inform social engineering--i.e. letting AI be initial 
guinea pigs, so the experiments we will inevitably conduct on ourselves 
will be better-designed. 

For example, before choosing a size, personality composition, and 
form of government for a team of humans to meet a challenge (or for a 
collaboration between humans and AI), we could use tournaments to find 
the range of events in which AI teams of that size, personality 
composition, and form of governmentment outperform the other options. 

Olympics are composed of diverse events which no competitor
has ever encountered before. In other words, competitors cannot win by 
mastering the events ahead of time--an Olympic tournament is a race to 
develop new mastery--so the champions are the players most likely to 
succeed when facing novel situations. They are optimized for "general 
intelligence" and likely would not win non-Olympic tournaments (i.e. 
for specific events). Choose the right game for the kind of 
intelligence you want to measure.

You can create a new tournament using the checkboxes on a Leaderboard or
Favoritism tab to select players. Benchmark tournaments  must include 
the current leader, a "Standard" player automatically generated for each 
game, and a player than plays randomly. Social History tournaments must
include player groups with extreme favoritism stats. A tournament could 
take days to run (esepcially for a difficult Olympics in which each 
competitor uses every moment of time available to it).
