Much as `Fold-It <https://fold.it/>`_ and `BridgeDesigner 
<https://bridgedesigner.org/>`_ offer simulations to test 
new designs for drugs and bridges, redscience offers 
simulations to test designs for personality, team composition, 
governance, and ethics. Any social interaction can be modeled 
with game theory, so redscience let users create and compare 
designs for “olympics” and player tools (a.k.a. “teams” of 
“bots”). Design advances in redscience until no olympics can 
be conceived for which a more reliable tool can be conceived. 
It's games studied rigorously enough to advance better social 
engineering (for both humans and AI). 

redscience is `open-source <https://github.com/ChrisSantosLang/
redscience/blob/master/LICENSE/>`_ and accompanied by 
educational resources so that diverse social groups can make 
their own versions which they fully understand and control. It 
is as much a :doc:`curriculum <curriculum>` about coding as it 
is :doc:`code <modules>`.
