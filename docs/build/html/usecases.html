<h1>Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Benchmark social designs (e.g. for an AI, or team of humans to make
policies or trade stocks).</strong> Rather than serve as pawns in battles for
power, establish authority via simulations. You can benchmark different
team-sizes, personality ratios, curriculum ratios, and collaboration
techniques (e.g. elitism vs pure democracy) on specific olympic events or
compare adaptability by benchmarking on diverse combinations of events
never encountered before. For example,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify the most comprehensive olympics via the comparison page,
identify the top team for that olympics via its leaderboard, and
identify an essential member of that team using its Members tab.</li>
<li>Clone the team to create a new contender, and slightly modify one
dimension of the personality of the cloned essential member (e.g. make
the clone less extreme)</li>
<li>Copy the parent’s training schedule to the clone and execute the training</li>
<li>Run an olympic tournament which includes both the current champion and
its modified clone. Does the modified clone outperform its parent, or
does the parent turn the extreme personality of that team-member into a
strength?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the most comprehensive olympics will include cooperative games
(like the Public Goods game), alliance games (like Risk), deception games
(like Hide and Seek), and probabilistic games (like Poker), as well as
traditionally competitive games (like Chess), so this approach to hedges
against the potential for any real-world game (e.g. stock trading) to
shift in any of these directions.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Find the skills of the future.</strong> We create more comprehensive olympics by
adding events that make different demands on players. For example:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify the most comprehensive olympics via the comparison page</li>
<li>Use the comparison page to identify an event that makes unique demands,
then fine-tune tools for that specific event (see #1 above).</li>
<li>Contrast the best tools for that event to the best tools for other
events to understand which tools’ biases are particularly advantageous
for that event.</li>
<li>Clone the event and tweak its design to make one of those biases even
more advantageous.</li>
<li>Use the comparison page to confirm that the new event is even more
unique, and that a new Olympics including that event is now the most
comprehensive.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Discover how you or any given personality (e.g. of a proposed AI) are
vulnerable to exploitation.</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Look at a player’s “Favoritism” tab to identify tools that perform
better against that player than against other players of its same
skill-level</li>
<li>Look at the Favoritism stats for those tools to find other players they
exploit in the same way. What do the victims have in common? (As
examples, depending on the game, a tool might exploit risk-aversion or
willingness to gamble.)</li>
<li>Browse the Favoritism tab to find games in which that vulnerability
does not manifest.</li>
<li>Compare victims’ Favoritism stats for playing alone vs using tools.
Which forms of tool use (if any) are sufficient to neutralize the
vulnerability (i.e. review, debate, delegation)? What is the difference
between using a tool to protect oneself from exploitation vs.
relinquishing freedom to that tool (e.g. To what extent is freedson
relinquished when taking advice from a jury, a news channel, a doctor,
a religious teacher, or an algorithm encoded in a scripture or law,
etc.)?</li>
</ol>
<p>WARNING: This can be humbling! But humility might come in handy…</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Elevate reality above experimentation.</strong> For example, the best strategy
in the Volunteer game depends upon prevailing social norms:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a private universe in which you train all tools to play
Volunteer via turn-taking (i.e. “You volunteered last time, now it’s
my turn”). Confirm that the social norms of that universe push all
tools towards turn-taking.</li>
<li>Create a separate private universe in which you train all tools to
play Volunteer via caste (i.e. whoever got the better deal last time
gets it again). Confirm that the social norms of that universe push
all tools towards a caste system (i.e. turn-taking backfires).</li>
<li>Create a third private universe composed half of players copied from
the turn-taking universe and half of players copied from the caste
universe. Which norm survives a Volunteer tournament? Similarly test
other population ratios to find the minimum ratio for the other norm
to survive.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we couldn’t run these experiments to our satisfaction in redscience,
would we be doomed to spend our real lives serving as the subjects of
such experiments (i.e. as pawns in a war between competing systems of
norms)? If the most-defensible norm is one you considered morally wrong,
does the evidence that “resistance is futile” make you reexamine the
basis for that moral belief?</p>
</li>
</ol>
