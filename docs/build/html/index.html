<h1>Welcome to redscience’s documentation!<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-redscience-s-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If you choose Blue Science, then you will believe what you want to believe. If
you choose Red Science, then you will learn life-changing truth. There is no
turning back, and no telling how deep the rabbit hole may go…</p>
<p>Blue Science says, “Clinical trials are what matter. We can’t clone entire
religions, businesses, or states, and manipulate them to form properly
controlled clinical trials of potential social policies, so social policies
can take root only in opinion.” It says, “History will determine which proposed
social technologies or other social changes are safe, but, by then, it will be
too late.”</p>
<p>A perfect clinical trial would require cloning the entire universe at least
twice: The exact proposed patient would receive the exact proposed treatment
in one cloned universe and receive the alternative in another. Any
less-expensive experiment is mere calibration for some simplified model. Blue
Science treats simplification as an excuse to defer to subjective
opinion–perhaps to the democratically-aggregated opinion of a minority (e.g.
of those who are currently alive, or of those with PhDs).</p>
<p>Red Science says, “A model oversimplifies only if a more reliable model is
readily available.” In other words, instead of letting subjective opinions
decide which clinical trials to fund, let pre-clinical trials drive the
clinical research agenda. Before serving as non-voluntary subjects in “natural
experiments” of history, run increasingly-sophisticated simulations, putting
the <em>least-expensive objective process</em> in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://fold.it/">Fold-It</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://bridgedesigner.org/">BridgeDesigner</a> facilitate pre-clinical science in the domains
of protein-folding and bridge design. By expanding that paradigm to the social
sciences, the redscience software package goes meta: It facilitates the
pre-clinical science of science. Any social interaction can be modeled with
game theory, so redscience builds on ipython, babel, trueskill, matplotlib,
and sk-learn to let users create and compare designs for “olympics” and player
tools (a.k.a. “teams” of “bots”).</p>
<p>Design advances in redscience until no olympics can be conceived for which a
more reliable tool can be conceived. Leaderboards are more objective and more
efficient than peer-reviewed journals; they make the agenda-setting level of
science as inexpensive and accessible as playing a video game. The speed with
which redscience can expose design-flaws in our inherited Blue-engineered
social institutions is so shocking that a warning is merited: Ignorance may
cause more damage in the long-run, but truth has a sting!</p>
<p>If you choose truth, and cannot find an existing redscience website on which
to explore, then you can make your own by… [how to install]</p>
<p>Any effective social science could be used to combat the exploitation that some
social groups currently suffer, but could also be used for exploitation. For
the security of society, redscience is therefore <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ChrisSantosLang/redscience/blob/master/LICENSE/">open-source</a> and
accompanied by educational resources so that diverse social groups can make
their own versions which they fully understand and control. It is as much a
curriculum about coding as it is code. Report bugs/ideas here, contribute code
here, contribute as an educator here.</p>
