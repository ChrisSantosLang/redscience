<p>If you choose Blue Science, then you will believe what you want to believe. If you choose Red Science, then you will learn life-changing truth. There is no turning back, and no telling how deep the rabbit hole may go…</p>
<p>Blue Science says, “Clinical trials are what matter. We can’t clone entire religions, businesses, or states, and manipulate them to form properly controlled clinical trials of potential social policies, so social policies can take root only in opinion.” It says, “History will determine which proposed social technologies or other social changes are safe, but, by then, it will be too late.”</p>
<p>A perfect clinical trial would require cloning the entire universe at least twice: The exact proposed patient would receive the exact proposed treatment in one cloned universe and receive the alternative in another. Any less-expensive experiment is mere calibration for some simplified model. Blue Science treats simplification as an excuse to defer to subjective opinion–perhaps to the democratically-aggregated opinion of a minority (e.g. of those who are currently alive, or of those with PhDs).</p>
<p>Red Science says, “A model oversimplifies only if a more reliable model is readily available.” In other words, instead of letting subjective opinions decide which clinical trials to fund, let pre-clinical trials drive the clinical research agenda. Before serving as non-voluntary subjects in “natural experiments” of history, run increasingly-sophisticated simulations, putting the <em>least-expensive objective process</em> in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>Fold-It and BridgeDesigner facilitate pre-clinical science in the domains of protein-folding and bridge design. By expanding that paradigm to the social sciences, the redscience software package goes meta: It facilitates the pre-clinical science of science. Any social interaction can be modeled with game theory, so redscience builds on ipython, babel, trueskill, matplotlib, and sk-learn to let users create and compare designs for “olympics” and player tools (a.k.a. “teams” of “bots”).</p>
<p>Design advances in redscience until no olympics can be conceived for which a more reliable tool can be conceived. Leaderboards are more objective and more efficient than peer-reviewed journals; they make the agenda-setting level of science as inexpensive and accessible as playing a video game. The speed with which redscience can expose design-flaws in our inherited Blue-engineered social institutions is so shocking that a warning is merited: Ignorance may cause more damage in the long-run, but truth has a sting!</p>
<p>If you choose truth, and cannot find an existing redscience website on which to explore, then you can make your own by… [how to install]</p>
<p>Any effective social science could be used to combat the exploitation that some social groups currently suffer, but could also be used for exploitation. For the security of society, redscience is therefore open-source (Apache license) and accompanied by educational resources so that diverse social groups can make their own versions which they fully understand and control. It is as much a curriculum about coding as it is code. Report bugs/ideas here, contribute code here, contribute as an educator here.</p>

<h2>Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Benchmark social designs (e.g. for an AI, or team of humans to make policies or trade stocks). Rather than serve as pawns in battles for power, establish authority via simulations. You can benchmark different team-sizes, personality ratios, curriculum ratios, and collaboration techniques (e.g. elitism vs pure democracy) on specific olympic events or compare adaptability by benchmarking on diverse combinations of events never encountered before.* For example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify the most comprehensive olympics via the comparison page, identify the top team for that olympics via its leaderboard, and identify an essential member of that team using its Members tab.</li>
<li>Clone the team to create a new contender, and slightly modify one dimensions of the personality of the cloned essential member (e.g. make the clone less extreme)</li>
<li>Copy the parent’s training schedule to the clone and execute the training</li>
<li>Run an olympic tournament which includes both the current champion and its modified clone. Does the modified clone outperform its parent, or does the parent turn the extreme personality of that team-member into a strength?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the most comprehensive olympics will include cooperative games (like the Public Goods game), alliance games (like Risk), deception games (like Hide and Seek), and probabilistic games (like Poker), as well as traditionally competitive games (like Chess), so this approach to hedges against the potential for any real-world game (e.g. stock trading) to shift in any of these directions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>#. Find the skills of the future. We create more comprehensive olympics by adding events that make different demands on players. For example:
Identify the most comprehensive olympics via the comparison page
Use the comparison page to identify an event that makes unique demands, then fine-tune tools for that specific event (see #1 above).
Contrast the best tools for that event to the best tools for other events to understand which tools’ biases are particularly advantageous for that event.
Clone the event and tweak its design to make one of those biases even more advantageous.
Use the comparison page to confirm that the new event is even more unique, and that a new Olympics including that event is now the most comprehensive.</p>
